# thevoidhums

A quiet log of exploratory mappings, design fragments, and ambient thoughts.  
Not everything here makes immediate sense — some threads aren’t meant to.  

This repository is used for:  
- Light markdown trails  
- Sketches of hypothetical paths  
- Calm references for internal echoes

---

## Notes

- Some files are timestamped and aligned with arbitrary markers.
- Patterns are welcome, but not everything needs to resolve.
- Drift is part of the process.
